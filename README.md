Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
It is the process of applying engineering techniques to develop softwares.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?

Software engineering is the process of applying engineering techniques and processes to develop softwares. Traditional programming applies the concept of writing code to curate specific instructions for a computer to follow. It differs from software engineering as it is not dynamic and it focuses on writing codes only. On the other hand, software engineering is not only about the code but entails difference approaches, including maintenance of the software.

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
This life cycle ensures the production of high-quality and affordable software that solves different problems. This life cycle entails:
-planning phase that invloves managing the product and the project of developing the software. Resource planning, project scheduling,and estimating costs. The developers collect crucial inforamtin from the stakeholders involved. The most important things needed for the project are filtrered during this phase.
-coding phase: Here, a system is designed by the developer in an integrated environment. Mulitple devices to be used are reviewed ,together with codes.
-Building phase: Codes that were developed earlier are reviewed and building of the software begins.
-Testing phase: THe created software is tested to identify hitches. This is to check whether the requirements of the stakeholder meet with the developed software. Any discrepancy found in the created software is rectified in this phase.
-Release phase: this process involves the packaging and managing releases in different environments.
- Deploy phase: the software is officialy released into the production environment.
- Operate phase: the software is used officially.
- Monitor phase: this is an important part of the life cycle as any hitches and bugs are looked out for. The elements that make up the software are frequently monitored. 

Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
-Agile model is the process of delivering a software prodcut in parts, instead of delivering a large project at once. The completed small parts are delivered in regular cycles until completion while Waterfall model follows a linear process of putting up a software. One part leads to other sequentially. 
-Besides, Agile model focuses mostly on customer feedback and involves customers frequently unlike waterfall that doesn't rely on customer feedback to complete a process.
In most cases, waterfall is most preffered as this model reduces waste in an ongoing operation. Also, waterfall gives a sense of direction to a softdev team as the are focused in completing each task before moving on to the next step.

Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
This is a field that involves identifying, analyzing and managing the needs and expectations for a designated software system. This process is cucial in the software development process as the required needs and expectations of he stakeholders are met.
Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Modularity is an important aspect in soft dev as it encourages independence among system components. This simplifies maintenance and increases the level of understanding of a system.

Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Testing is crucial in software development as errors and system defects are identified are rectified.
-Unit testing involves in-testing of individual methods and functions used by a certain software.
-Integration testing checks on how different components of a certain application interact together. It helps to identify errors that might emanate from the combination of these applications.
-System testing evaluates the overall performance of an application. This is done after unit and integration testing.

Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Version control systems are tools that ease the work of software developers as they enable software developes to maange changes to source code. These systems enhance productivity and helps in recovery in the case of a disaster. Popular version control systems include Git, which is a distributed VCS. 
Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
An SPM plans and oversees every step of a project. He/ She oversees a software development team, gives out work effectively  and ensures collaboration. Besides, he/she tracks the progress of a project and manages the deliverables of the project.

Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Software maintenance is the process of modifying a software product after its creation and delivery. Maintenance is a crucial process as it improves performance of a software, increases data security and ensures a seamless project continutiy.
Types include:
-Adaptive: This process ensures existing software adapt to changing environments and business needs. This includes activities such as making changes to as OS.
- corrective: This is fixing of errors in a software such as bugs and viruses.
- Preventive: This maintenance keeps a software running for a long time with few issues. Activities include installing anti-virus software and code optimization.

Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?

Issues include privacy, copyright concerns, bias accuracy and accessibility.
Software engineers should see to it that they focus on R&D to learn on trends and reduce on  copyright infringement. Further, they should adhere to professional standards by being truthful on theor qualifications and capabilities.
Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
Submit your completed assignment by [9th June].
